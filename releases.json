(#558 - @snapwich)\n- Custom sendStandardTargeting implemented in bidderSettings per bidder (#559 - @snapwich)\n- Support for ie9 in ajax helper function (#570 - @snapwich)\n- Adding deal support to Openx adapter #596 (#601 - @jaiminpanchal27)\n- Add IX Deal Support for IndexExchange adapter (#638 - @indexexchange)\n\n### Video Support (Beta)\n- Prebid.js now supports video adUnits, defining bidders as video-enabled, and building a master video tag.\n- adUnits can support video demand requests by setting `mediaType` to `video`. When an adUnit is configured to support video, all bidders within that adUnit must be video-enabled as well, as configured in `adapters.json`.\n\n``` JavaScript\nconst adUnit2 = {\n  code: topSlotCode,\n  mediaType: 'video',\n  sizes: topSlotSizes,\n  bids: [\n    {\n      bidder: 'appnexusAst',\n      params: {\n        placementId: 'id',\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n```\n- Define bidders as video-enabled in `adapters.json`\n  Currently only \"appnexusAst\" is supported for video. We expect other adapters to start updating their code to support video in the future. \n\n``` JavaScript\n{\n    \"appnexusAst\": {\n      \"supportedMediaTypes\": [\"video\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that media type `banner` is implied for existing adapters. \n- Build a master video tag with `pbjs.buildMasterVideoTagFromAdserverTag(adserverTag, options)`. Example usage:\n\n``` JavaScript\nconst adserverTag = '<dfp_tag>'; // base ad server tag, see: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/1068325\nconst options = {\n    'adserver': 'dfp',\n    'code': 'video1' // code that matches the video adUnit declared above\n};\n// generate URL\nconst masterTagUrl = pbjs.buildMasterVideoTagFromAdserverTag(adserverTag, options);\n// send masterTagUrl to the video player\ninvokeVideoPlayer(masterTagUrl);\n```\n\n### New `pbjs.bidderSettings`\n- Keys with no value can be suppressed from the ad server by setting `suppressEmptyKeys` to `true`. The default for this key is `false`.\n\n``` JavaScript\n$$PREBID_GLOBAL$$.bidderSettings =\n{\n    standard: {\n        suppressEmptyKeys: true,\n        adserverTargeting: [\n            {\n                key: \"aKeyWithAValue\",\n                val: 42\n            },\n            {\n                key: \"aKeyWithAnEmptyValue\",\n                val: \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n};\n```\n- Setting `sendStandardTargeting` to `false` will prevent the standard targeting values from being sent to the ad server. In the example below, only the `custom`  key will be sent to the ad server.\n\n``` JavaScript\n$$PREBID_GLOBAL$$.bidderSettings =\n{\n    appnexus: {\n        alwaysUseBid: true,\n        sendStandardTargeting: false,\n        adserverTargeting: [\n            {\n                key: \"hb_bidder\",\n                val: function (bidResponse) {\n                    return bidResponse.bidderCode;\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                key: \"hb_adid\",\n                val: function (bidResponse) {\n                    return bidResponse.adId;\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                key: \"hb_pb\",\n                val: function (bidResponse) {\n                    return bidResponse.pbHg;\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                key: \"custom\",\n                    val: 42\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### New Adapters\n\n#### Centro\n\n``` JavaScript\n{\n    bidder: 'centro',\n    params: {\n      unit: 28136,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Adblade\n\n``` JavaScript\n{\n    bidder: 'adblade',\n    params: {\n        partnerId: 39875,\n        bidfloor: 0.01  // OPTIONAL float bid floor in $ CPM\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Piximedia\n\n``` JavaScript\n{\n    bidder: 'piximedia',\n    params: {\n      siteId: 'PIXIMEDIA',\n      placementId: 'PREBID'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### GetIntent\n\n``` JavaScript\n{\n    bidder: 'getintent',\n    params: {\n      pid: '7',\n      tid: 'prebid_test',\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Maintenance\n- End2end testing (#571 - @jaiminpanchal27)\n- Karma opens debug.html by default (#540 - @protonate)\n- Log unsupported ad type only for good bids (#547 - @matthewlane)\n- getBidderCodes now loops over adUnits object if passed (#557 - @snapwich)\n- Added rubicon adapter unit tests and renamed var to bidderRequest to be more accurate (#576 - @snapwich)\n- Set bid response ID to bid request ID for triplelift. (#567 - @nanek)\n- Set bid response ID to bid request ID for aardvark. (#568 - @nanek)\n- Update Sonobi adapter for: config settings, video, floor, deals, unit tests (#591 - @Studnicky)\n- Make jshint errors more obvious. (#603 - @mkendall07)\n- Add back legacy DFP example. Update instant load method to mitigate issue #419 - race condition fix. (#569 - @mkendall07)\n- Prevent renderAd from overwriting the website DOM document (#607 - @kasparsd)\n- Allow bypassing ajax preflights with config options (#630 - @matthewlane)\n- Added timeouts to rubicon adapter that consider time-to-start costs (#629 - @snapwich)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Ensure that all deal bid keys are truncated to DFP max length - #578 (#580 - @indexexchange)\n- Deal override fix to resolve #618 (#619 - @indexexchange)\n- Use var ad instead of incorrect ads in rubicon adapter (#546 - @snapwich)\n- Restore url.js and modifications to ajax.js (#551 - @protonate)\n- Fixed error in safari (#555 - @dmitriyshashkin)\n- Add withCredentials into appnexusAst adapter request. (#573 - @mkendall07)\n- Fix(krux): add undefined checks for no bid responses to kruxlink adapter (#584 - @sethyates)\n- Callback deleted before calling clearAuction (#636 - @protonate)\n- Use `splice` rather than `slice` to remove bids from array (#637 - @protonate)\n- Modify handling of no-bids in Krux Link adapter (#628 - @jgreens)\n- Accept custom timeout (#641 - @protonate). You may see less bids eligible to participate in the auction as a result. We have added `$$PREBID_GLOBAL$$.timeoutBuffer` to mitigate the affect of the hard timeout value. This value can be adjusted up/down for publisher to fine tune results.\n- Fixed 'pbjs is not defined' error (#640 - @mkendall07)\n\n## Removed\n- Unused build dependencies (#622 - @matthewlane)\n\n[Commit Log](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/compare/0.12.0...0.13.0)\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/3901284","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/3901284/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/3901284/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/tag/0.12.0","id":3901284,"author":{"login":"protonate","id":4116940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTY5NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4116940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate","html_url":"https://github.com/protonate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protonate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM5MDEyODQ=","tag_name":"0.12.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Prebid 0.12.0 Release","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-08-22T22:40:44Z","published_at":"2016-08-22T23:08:43Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/tarball/0.12.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/zipball/0.12.0","body":"This version of Prebid.js brought to you by over 20 members of the open source community.

The accepted values are, \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" and \"auto\", with \"medium\" being the default. Also introduces the \"auto\" price bucket which applies a sliding scale to determine granularity as:\n\n| cpm | granularity |\n| --- | --- |\n| cpm < 5 | .05 increments |\n| cpm > 5 and < 10 | .10 increments |\n| cpm > 10 and < 20 | .50 increments |\n| cpm > 20 | pb capped at 20 |\n\n### Alias adapters with config setting\n\nAdapter aliases can be specified in the \"adapters\" section of `./package.json`. You can pass an object in the adapters array as shown:\n\n```\n\"adapters\": [\n    \"triplelift\",\n    \"rubicon\",\n    { \"appnexus\": {\"alias\": \"brealtime\"} }\n  ]\n```\n\nThis syntax could also be used to pass additional build-level config to a given adapter, though alias is the only such property read in the adapter loader at the moment.\n\n### New Metadata for Github account and version\n\nA new metadata string can be found in `constants.json` for \"REPO_AND_VERSION\" which provides the Github account name that the code was downloaded from (e.g. \"prebid\") the library (\"prebid\") and version (\"0.8.0\"). This can be useful for included in bid requests or for analytics. The returned value is e.g. `\"prebid_prebid_0.8.0\"`.\n\n### Analytics Customization\n\nGoogle Analytics named trackers are now supported. A custom tracker name (or multiple tracker names) can be registerd with GA on your page like so:\n\n```\nga('create', 'UA-xxxxxxxx-x', 'auto', 'customTrackerName');\n```\n\nAnd used with prebid by passing that tracker name in the `pbjs.enableAnalytics` options:\n\n```\npbjs.enableAnalytics({\n provider: 'ga',\n options: {\n  global: 'ga', // <string> name of GA global. Default is 'ga'\n  trackerName: 'customTrackerName',\n  enableDistribution: false, // <bool> enable/disable distribution. Recommend disable to save bandwidth/calls\n }\n});\n```\n\n### Always send default keys\n\nBidders will always get key value pairs that are set in the default (i.e. `hb_pb`, `hb_bidder`, `hb_adid`, `hb_size`) even if using `alwaysUseBid=true`. If you choose to use the same key as the default keys, the standard value will be overwritten with the custom value.\n\n---\n\n## Bug fixes in this release\n- [#267](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/267) Fix for `pbjs` not defined error - reported by @dmitriyshashkin\n- [#269](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/269) and [272](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/272) Fix for Google Analytics not reporting initial events or timeout events (reported by @dmitriyshashkin)\n- [#254](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/254) Fix for Rubicon adapter bug with multiple iframes (reported by @Deimos01 and fixed by @bretg)\n- [#245] Use `node 4.x` or greater\n- [#279] Fix `bids undefined` error (fixed by @steven-hadfield)\n- Other misc bug fixes (see the full commit log here: https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/compare/0.7.0...0.8.0)\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/2810143","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/2810143/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/2810143/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/tag/0.7.0","id":2810143,"author":{"login":"mkendall07","id":1870166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzAxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1870166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07","html_url":"https://github.com/mkendall07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI4MTAxNDM=","tag_name":"0.7.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Prebid 0.7.0 Release","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-03-14T20:42:14Z","published_at":"2016-03-14T20:47:09Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/assets/1421559","id":1421559,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE0MjE1NTk=","name":"prebid.js_0.7.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"mkendall07","id":1870166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzAxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1870166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07","html_url":"https://github.com/mkendall07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":27615,"download_count":146,"created_at":"2016-03-14T20:49:28Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T20:49:30Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/download/0.7.0/prebid.js_0.7.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/tarball/0.7.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/zipball/0.7.0","body":"## New Features in this release\n- **New public API for `bidWon`** Event can be listened to when bids are registered\n- **New adapter for NginAd** (contributed by @nginadfoundation) \n- **[Beta] Updated adapter for AppNexus** Adapter uses new SDK for loading ads and groups requests.\n- **New adapter for TripleLift** Adapter added (contributed by @mattjone ) \n- **Dynamic adapter selection** Updated build process to specify which adapters to include in the final build.

New Features in this release\n- **Sovrn** Adapter added (contributed by @pwfsd with support from Sovrn team) \n- [BETA] **Analytics** data collection and GA adapter added for quick integration\n\n## Breaking Change in this release\n- Casale renamed to IndexExchange\n\n### How to add bidder Sovrn:\n\n```\nvar adUnits = [{\n        code: '/9968336/header-bid-tag-0',\n        sizes: [[300, 250], [300, 600]],\n        bids: [{\n            bidder: 'sovrn',\n            params: {\n                tagid: '123'\n            }\n        }]\n}];\n\n```\n\n### Analytics integration with GA\n\nIf your site uses analytics.js collection, a simple toggle will automatically send crucial data points to your account.\n\n**Enable GA collection:**\n\n```\nga('create', 'XXXXXX', 'auto');\n//Send data from prebid.js automatically \npbjs.que.push(function() {\n    pbjs.enableAnalytics({\n        provider: 'ga',\n        options: {\n            global: 'ga', // <string> name of GA global. Default is 'ga'\n            enableDistribution: false, // <bool> enable/disable distribution data (see prebid.org for more information). If you're working with more than 3 bidders, we recommend this flag set to false for the following reason (in notes).\n        }\n    });\n});\n\n```\n\nNote: GA throttles the max number of requests that can be sent with analytics.js to 20 initial + 2/second. If you're using more than 5 bidders, the GA throttling may prevent some data from being sent. We're implementing a data reporting queue in the next few releases to address this issue. See this [link](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/limits-quotas) for details on GA's throttling. \n\n### Breaking Change: Deprecated bidder name Casale - now called IndexExchange\n\nThe bidderCode  `casale` has been updated to  `indexExchange`. Please update your configuration appropriately if using this bidder. Also of note is that IndexExchange will be upgraded to v9 of the their API in the next prebid.js release. \n\n**Before**\n\n```\nvar adUnits = [{\n        code: '/9968336/header-bid-tag-0',\n        sizes: [[300, 250], [300, 600]],\n        bids: [{\n            bidder: 'casale',\n             params: {\n                    slotId: 'TO ADD',    // <String>\n                    casaleUrl: 'TO ADD'  //  <String>\n                }\n        }]\n}];\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```\nvar adUnits = [{\n        code: 'div-id-header-bid-tag-0',\n        sizes: [[300, 250], [300, 600]],\n        bids: [{\n             bidder: 'indexExchange',\n             params: {\n                    slotId: 'TO ADD',   // <String>\n                    indexUrl: 'TO ADD'  //  <String>\n                }\n        }]\n}];\n```\n\n## Bug fixes in this release\n- Fixed issue with YieldBot adapter not sending back bad bids\n- Fixed issue with bidsBackHandler execution timing (#98)\n- Fixed issue with clearing DFP slot targeting (#104)\n- Fixed issue with RefreshBids with adUnitCodes not working correctly (#101)\n- Fixed issue with `alwaysUseBid=true` not working correctly\n- Other misc bug fixes\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/2009090","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/2009090/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/2009090/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/tag/0.4.0","id":2009090,"author":{"login":"mkendall07","id":1870166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzAxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1870166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07","html_url":"https://github.com/mkendall07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIwMDkwOTA=","tag_name":"0.4.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Prebid 0.4.0 released!","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2015-10-23T14:47:15Z","published_at":"2015-10-23T15:06:52Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/assets/969602","id":969602,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDk2OTYwMg==","name":"Prebid.js_0.4.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"mkendall07","id":1870166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzAxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1870166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07","html_url":"https://github.com/mkendall07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkendall07/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":38937,"download_count":35,"created_at":"2015-10-23T15:07:33Z","updated_at":"2015-10-23T15:07:33Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/download/0.4.0/Prebid.js_0.4.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/tarball/0.4.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/zipball/0.4.0","body":"New 0.4.0 release with some minor configuration adjustments and functionality.\n\n### Recommended configuration change for use with DFP\n\nRecommend to use `div_id` for the `adUnit.code` instead of the `adUnitPath` that was previously recommended.

Note that this new API has introduced a few **breaking changes**:\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n##### Change 1: A command queue\n\nNow all pbjs commands should be wrapped by `pbjs.que.push`. This ensures pbjs commands are in scope and are executed in the right order. Example:\n\n```\npbjs.que.push(function() {\n   pbjs.setTargetingForGPTAsync();\n});\n```\n\n##### Change 2: Add ad units\n\nInstead of directly pushing objects into the pbjs.adUnits array (as in the previous versions), the new API requires the function `pbjs.addAdUnits(adUnits)`. Example:\n\n```\nvar adUnits = [{\n        code: '/9968336/header-bid-tag-0',\n        sizes: [[300, 250], [300, 600]],\n        bids: [{\n            bidder: 'appnexus',\n            params: { placementId: 'TO ADD' }\n        }]\n}];\npbjs.addAdUnits(adUnits);\n```\n\n##### Change 3: Request bids\n\nPreviously, prebid.js automatically sends out bid requests as soon as the library loads. This isn't needed for many sites. The new API requires the page to explicit call `pbjs.requestBids` to send out bid requests. Example:\n\n```\npbjs.requestBids({\n    bidsBackHandler: function(bidResponses) { }\n});\n```\n\n##### Change 4: Bids back callback\n\nThe callback when requested bids are returned are now in `pbjs.requestBids` (as in the above example). No more ~~`pbjs.registerBidCallbackHandler()`~~\n\n### Deprecated Functions\n\n##### 1. Function ~~`getAdserverTargetingParamsForAdUnit(adUnitCode)`~~\n\nIt's now split into `getAdserverTargeting()` and `getAdserverTargetingForAdUnitCode([adunitCode])`\nFind out [docs here](http://prebid.org/publisher-api.html#function-reference)\n\n##### 2. Function ~~`requestBidsForAdUnit(adUnitCode)`~~\n\nIt's now `requestBids()`\n\n##### 3. Function ~~`registerBidCallbackHandler()`~~\n\nIt's now a callback within the `requestBids()`\n\n### New Features\n\n##### 1. Request selected array of bids\n\n```\npbjs.requestBids({\n    adUnitCodes: ['/99336/slot-0'],\n    bidsBackHandler: function() {\n        pbjs.setTargetingForGPTAsync(['/99336/slot-0']);\n        googletag.pubads().refresh([slotObj]); \n    }\n});\n```\n\nSee docs for `pbjs.requestBids()`\nhttp://prebid.org/publisher-api.html#function-reference\n\n##### 2. New callback functionality (more events will be added)\n\nA new callback when all bids are back for individual ad units:\n\n```\npbjs.addCallback('adUnitBidsBack', function(adUnitCode){\n       console.log('ad unit bids back for : ' + adUnitCode);\n});\n```\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/1665263","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/1665263/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/1665263/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/tag/0.2.1","id":1665263,"author":{"login":"prebid","id":13242760,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEzMjQyNzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13242760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid","html_url":"https://github.com/prebid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prebid/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE2NjUyNjM=","tag_name":"0.2.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 0.2.1 -
